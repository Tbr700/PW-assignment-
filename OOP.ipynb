        "# What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, rather than functions or logic. An object is an instance of a class, which is a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior (data and methods) of that object.\n",
        "\n",
        "#What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "Classes are the building blocks of OOP in the realm of C++. It's similar to creating a prototype for a certain sort of object, encapsulating its attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. They enable you to simulate real-world entities, abstract notions, or any aspect of your issue area. Assume you're creating a virtual zoo program. You'd construct a Animal class with attributes such as name, species, and age, as well as actions such as eat, sleep, and makeSound.\n",
        "\n",
        "# What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class that encapsulates both data (known as attributes or state) and behaviors (known as methods or functions). It is a fundamental building block that represents a real-world or conceptual entity in a program. Each object has a unique identity, stores specific values for its attributes, and can perform actions defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "**Abstraction** is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features or functionality to the user. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. For example, a car’s steering wheel abstracts away the complex mechanics of the engine; the driver only needs to know how to steer (the functionality), not the engine details. Abstraction is typically achieved using abstract classes, interfaces, or abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation** is the mechanism of bundling the data (variables) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit (like a class) and restricting direct access to some of an object's components. This is done to protect the internal state and ensure controlled interaction through access modifiers like private, public, or protected. Encapsulation focuses more on how the object’s data is hidden and protected from outside interference or misuse, providing data hiding and security.\n",
        "\n",
        "# What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Dunder methods in Python (short for “double underscore” methods), also known as “magic methods” or “special methods,” are methods with names that begin and end with double underscores, like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__len__`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods are automatically invoked by Python to perform built-in operations or to customize the behavior of objects. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `__init__(self, ...)`: Called when an object is initialized.\n",
        "- `__str__(self)`: Called when `str()` or `print()` is used on the object.\n",
        "- `__repr__(self)`: Called by `repr()` or the interactive interpreter.\n",
        "- `__len__(self)`: Called by `len()`.\n",
        "- `__getitem__(self, key)`: Invoked when using indexing (e.g., `obj[key]`).\n",
        "- `__add__(self, other)`: Called when using the `+` operator.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods let you define how objects of your class behave with built-in Python functions and operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept where a new class, called a subclass or child class, is created based on an existing class, called a superclass or parent class. This mechanism allows the child class to inherit the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of the parent class, promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the ability of objects, functions, or variables to take on multiple forms depending on the context. It allows the same interface or method to be used for different underlying data types or classes, enabling objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface while each class can implement the behavior differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main types:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Compile-time polymorphism (Static polymorphism):** Achieved through method overloading or operator overloading, where the method called is determined at compile time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Run-time polymorphism (Dynamic polymorphism):** Achieved via method overriding, where the method that is executed is determined at run time based on the actual class of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "# How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Encapsulation is like wrapping your favorite sandwich in foil. It keeps all the delicious ingredients (data) safe and sound, away from the prying hands of the world (other code). In programming, encapsulation is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) that restricts direct access to some of an object’s components. This is done to prevent the accidental modification of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it this way: if you had a pet goldfish, you wouldn’t want just anyone to stick their hands in the tank, right? You’d want to keep it safe and sound. Encapsulation does just that for your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "A constructor in Python is a special method named __init__() that is automatically called when a new object of a class is created. Its main purpose is to initialize the object's attributes or set up its initial state. The __init__ method takes at least one parameter, self, which refers to the instance being created, and optionally other parameters to initialize attributes.\n",

        "Key points about Python constructors:\n",

However, unlike languages such as Java or C++, Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense. If you define multiple methods with the same name in a class, only the last defined method is used, and the previous definitions are overridden\n",

        "Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a feature that allows a subclass (child class) to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class). When the subclass defines a method with the same name, same parameters (signature), and same return type as the superclass method, it overrides the behavior of that method. This means that when the method is called on an object of the subclass, the subclass’s version of the method is executed instead of the superclass’s version.\n",

It allows you to define cleanup actions like releasing external resources (e.g., closing files, deleting temporary data, or closing network connections) right before the object is removed from memory\n"
